Hi, I'm Sophie, a Makers graduate and full-stack developer. 

Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building 'things'. I have always been drawn to the tech side of any design problem and thus developed my software skills (ranging from advanced CAD/3D modelling, to photoshopping visuals and using illustrator to create beautiful diagrams) to fullfill the project breif.

I am now looking for a front-end or full-stack software developer role where I can use my previous experience as well as my new coding skills to make amazing products.
