### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Sophie, a Makers graduate and full-stack developer. Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building 'things'. Always drawn to the tech side of any design problem, I developped my software skills ranging from advanced CAD/3D modelling to photoshopping visuals and using illustrator to create beautiful diagrams. 

I am now looking for as a full stack software developper role where I can use my previous experience as well as my new coding skills to make amazing products.
