<h2 align="center">  👋 Hi, I'm Sophie, a Makers graduate and full-stack developer. 

<p align="center"> Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building cool things -  from a single page thermostat app to 100 apartment housing projects. 

<p align="center">I should have known I'd end up as a dev as I was always been drawn to the software solution to any design problem from advanced CAD/3D modelling, photoshop and illustrator to writing that script.

 💻 **I am now looking for a role as a software developer**  where I can use my previous experience as well as my Ruby and Javascript skills to work on exciting projects.

 👩  **My pronouns are**  she/her
 
 🧶 **I’m currently working** on a responsive React App providing tools to help design knitware[sophieworsnop.com](https://sophieworsnop.com) (see the project on github [here](https://github.com/sophiewo/sophieknits))
 
 🏠  **To see some of my architectural work** [sophieworsnop.com](https://sophieworsnop.com)

 🌿 **When I'm not coding** you can find me gardening or knitting
