Hi, I'm Sophie, a Makers graduate and full-stack developer. 

Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building cool things, from a single page thermostat app to 100 apartment housing projects. 

I have always been drawn to the tech side of any design problem, from advanced CAD/3D modelling, photoshop and illustrator to scripts 

I am now looking for a front-end or full-stack software developer role where I can use my previous experience as well as my Ruby and Javascript skills to work on exciting projects.

 ðŸŒ¿ **When I'm not coding** you can find me gardening or knitting, (check out my knits [here](https://www.instagram.com/sophieknits_/))
