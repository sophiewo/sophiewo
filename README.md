## 👋 Hi, I'm Sophie, a web-developer + architectural/landscape designer

### I'm also a knitting addict and produce knitwear and patterns over at [SophieKnits_](https://www.instagram.com/sophieknits_)

👩  **My pronouns are**  she/her

👩‍💻 **Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building cool things** from a React Apps that helps design knitwear to 100 apartment housing projects. I should have known I'd end up as a dev of some sort, I've always been drawn to the software solution to any design problem
from advanced CAD/3D modelling, photoshop and illustrator to writing that script for counting knitting stitches.


 💻 **Let's work together** I am always interested in hearing about freelance opportunities where I can use my experience of 10+ years working in architecture and design as well as my full stack skills gained at Makers Academy. Get in touch below

🌿 **When I'm not coding** you can find me gardening or knitting
