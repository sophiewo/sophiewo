Hi, I'm Sophie, a Makers graduate and full-stack developer. Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building 'things'. I have always been drawn to the tech side of any design problem and thus developped my software skills (ranging from advanced CAD/3D modelling to photoshopping visuals and using illustrator to create beautiful diagrams) to fullfill the project breif.  

I am now looking for a full-stack software developer role where I can use my previous experience as well as my new coding skills to make amazing products. 

 ðŸ”­  **Iâ€™m currently working** on my website [sophieworsnop.com](https://sophieworsnop.com) (see the project on github [here](https://github.com/sophiewo/sophieworsnop))

 ðŸŒ±  **Iâ€™m currently developing my knowledge of** REACT

 ðŸ˜„  **My pronouns are**  she/her

 âš¡ **When I'm not coding** you can find me gardening or knitting, (check out my instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/sophieknits_/))
