### 👋

Hi, I'm Sophie. a Makers graduate and full-stack developer. Coming from an architectural background I've spent my career thus far building 'things'. Always drawn to the tech side of any design problem, I developped my software skills ranging from advanced CAD/3D modelling to photoshopping visuals and using illustrator to create beautiful diagrams. 

I am now looking for as a full stack software developper role where I can use my previous experience as well as my new coding skills to make amazing products. 

 🔭  **I’m currently working** on my website [sophieworsnop.com](https://sophieworsnop.com) (see the project on github [here](www.github.com/sophiewo))

 🌱  **I’m currently developing my knowledge of** REACT

 😄  **My pronouns are**  she/her

 ⚡ **When Im not coding** you can find me gardening or knitting, (check out my instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/sophieknits_/))
